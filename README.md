## Description

I am a student at Politecnico di Milano and every time at the beginning of the semester I find it annoying to have to manually enter my weekly commitments into Google Calendar so I decided to create this small extension that automatically saves all the weekly timetable within your Google account , it is currently still under review by Google, as soon as it is published I will insert the installation link below

## Install

[**Chrome** extension]() <!-- TODO: Add chrome extension link inside parenthesis -->
