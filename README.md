## Description

I am a student at Politecnico di Milano, every time at the beginning of the semester I find annoying to have to manually enter my weekly commitments into Google Calendar. 
So I decided to create this small extension that automatically saves all the weekly timetable into your Google account. 

## Demo

## Privacy Policy

Since the extension requires access to the user's Google account, I attach the [privacy policy](https://leonardosinibaldi.com/PoliMiToCalendar/)

## Install

It is currently still under review by Google, as soon as it is published I will insert the installation link below.
